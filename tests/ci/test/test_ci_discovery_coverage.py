"""A test file that CI never opens is documentation, not a test.

pytest's testpaths is ./tests and ci_register scans four roots under it, so a
test file parked next to the code it tests runs only when a human remembers to.
Fifteen of them had accumulated that way -- the openenv example alone carried
ten files and a hundred offline tests that cost two seconds and needed no SDK --
and #2545 is what the arrangement costs: a regression test for the
file-descriptor leak that stopped a 16-node run, added to a file no CI job would
ever collect.

Hence the rule these tests hold: a test file lives under tests/, and a test that
cannot run somewhere says so itself with a module-level skip (see the hud suites'
``importorskip``). A skip is reported by the runner and starts working the day its
dependency lands; a file outside the tree is invisible either way.

``_KNOWN_ORPHANS`` is the escape hatch, and it is built to shrink: a third test
fails once the file an entry names has moved, so a stale exception cannot linger.
