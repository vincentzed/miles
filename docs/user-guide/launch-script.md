title: Launch Script
description: What a Miles launch script does when you run it, how it is structured, and the three ways to override a recipe.
---
Every supported model ships as a python launch script under `scripts/`, and starting a
training run is one command:

```bash
python scripts/run_qwen3_dense.py --model-name Qwen3-4B
```

This page explains what that command does and how to change what it runs. For the
meaning of individual training flags, see [Argument Groups](/user-guide/argument-groups)
and the [CLI Reference](/user-guide/cli-reference).

## How a launch script starts a training job

A launch script is a recipe, not the training process. It assembles the full `train.py`
command line for one model family, starts a local Ray cluster, and submits the command
as a Ray job. The pieces involved:

| Layer | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Launch script | `scripts/run_*.py` | Holds the recipe: per-model values and the flag blocks |
| Model definition | `scripts/models/<type>.py` | Provides the Megatron architecture flags |
| Command utilities | `miles/utils/external_utils/command_utils/` | Starts Ray and submits the job |
| Training entrypoint | `train.py` / `train_async.py` | The actual training process, run inside the Ray job |

{/* FIGURE PLACEHOLDER — horizontal flow diagram:
   scripts/run_*.py → command_utils.execute_train → [ray start --head → ray job submit]
   → train.py (inside the Ray job).
   Side branch: scripts/models/<megatron_model_type>.py —load_model_args→ architecture
   flags spliced into the train.py argv.
   Annotate: everything left of "ray job submit" runs in the head-node shell. */}

When the script starts, it prints its resolved options as a table, then every shell
command it issues with an `EXEC:` prefix — the log is a complete record of what ran.

### Running a v1 launch script

Older Ray launch scripts can keep the free-function API by importing its compatibility module:

```python
import miles.utils.external_utils.command_utils.legacy as U
```

It retains `execute_train`, the command and checkpoint helpers, dataset download,
Mooncake startup, and the original `ExecuteTrainConfig`. New scripts build a backend
with `config.create_backend()`; the compatibility API does not support Kubernetes.

## The structure of a launch script

The sections below walk `scripts/run_qwen3_dense.py`; every launcher follows the same
layout. The module docstring states the prerequisites (a converted checkpoint, the
datasets) and a runnable example, then three parts follow in file order.

### Selecting a recipe with `--model-name`

For some models one launcher provides multiple recipes, selected with `--model-name`.
The per-variant values live in a `_RECIPES` table at the top of the file:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class _Recipe:
    megatron_model_type: str
    tensor_model_parallel_size: int
    max_tokens_per_gpu: int
    rollout_num_gpus_per_engine: int
    sglang_mem_fraction_static: float
    optimizer_cpu_offload: bool
    num_rollout: int = 3000
    extra_sglang_args: str = ""

_RECIPES: dict[str, _Recipe] = {
    "Qwen3-4B": _Recipe("qwen3-4B", 2, 9216, 2, 0.7, False),
    "Qwen3.5-27B": _Recipe("qwen3.5-27B", 4, 8192, 1, 0.5, True),
    # ... one entry per supported variant
}
```

Single-recipe launchers skip the table and write their values directly in the flag
blocks.

### ScriptArgs — script options as CLI flags and `MILES_SCRIPT_*` env vars

The script's own options are the fields of a `ScriptArgs` dataclass:

```python
@dataclass
class ScriptArgs(U.ExecuteTrainConfig):
    run_id: str = U.create_run_id()
    model_name: _MODEL_NAMES = "Qwen3-4B"
    num_gpus_per_node: int = 8
    enable_eval: bool = True
    save: bool = True
    extra_args: str = ""
    data_dir: str = "/root/datasets"
    model_dir: str = "/root/models"
    megatron_path: str = "/root/Megatron-LM"
```

The `@U.dataclass_cli` decorator exposes each field twice: as a `--kebab-case` command
line option (`--model-dir`) and as an environment variable with the `MILES_SCRIPT_`
prefix (`MILES_SCRIPT_MODEL_DIR`). A value given on the command line beats the
environment variable, which beats the field default. The env form is how launch
wrappers and cluster tooling inject machine-specific values without editing the script.

Options shared by every launcher, from the `ExecuteTrainConfig` base class and repo
convention:

| Option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--model-dir` | `/root/models` | Where checkpoints (HF and `torch_dist`) are read from |
| `--data-dir` | `/root/datasets` | Where prompt and eval datasets are read from |
| `--output-dir` | `/root/shared_data` | Where checkpoints and dumps are written |
| `--num-nodes` | `$SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES` or 1 | Number of training nodes |
| `--num-gpus-per-node` | 8 | GPUs used on each node |
| `--extra-args` | empty | Extra flags appended to the `train.py` command line |
| `--extra-env-vars` | empty | Extra env vars added to the Ray runtime env |

### execute() — assembling the train.py flags from grouped blocks

The `execute()` function builds the `train.py` command line as one f-string block per
concern, then concatenates them:

```python
ckpt_args = (
    f"--hf-checkpoint {args.model_dir}/{args.model_name} "
    f"--ref-load {args.model_dir}/{args.model_name}_torch_dist "
    f"--load {args.output_dir}/checkpoints "
)

grpo_args = (
    "--advantage-estimator grpo "
    "--use-kl-loss "
    "--kl-loss-coef 0.00 "
    "--eps-clip 0.2 "
    "--eps-clip-high 0.28 "
)

train_args = f"{ckpt_args} {rollout_args} {optimizer_args} {grpo_args} ... {args.extra_args}"
```

Each block maps to a section of [Argument Groups](/user-guide/argument-groups), which
documents the flags themselves:

| Block | Flags documented at |
|---|---|
| `ckpt_args` | [Checkpoint paths](/user-guide/argument-groups#ckpt-args) |
| `rollout_args` | [Sampling and reward](/user-guide/argument-groups#rollout-args) |
| `eval_args` | [Evaluation](/user-guide/argument-groups#eval-args) |
| `perf_args` | [Parallelism and memory](/user-guide/argument-groups#perf-args) |
| `grpo_args` | [RL objective](/user-guide/argument-groups#grpo-args) |
| `optimizer_args` | [Optimizer](/user-guide/argument-groups#optimizer-args) |
| `sglang_args` | [Rollout engine](/user-guide/argument-groups#sglang-args) |
| `misc_args` | [GPU layout and everything else](/user-guide/argument-groups#misc-args) |

One block has no Argument Groups section: the wandb flags come from
`U.get_default_wandb_args`, which returns them only when `WANDB_API_KEY` is set — so
wandb logging turns on by exporting the key, with no script change.

## Three ways to override a recipe

From lightest to heaviest:

1. **Append flags with `--extra-args`.** The value is appended to the end of the
   `train.py` command line, and for a flag given twice the later occurrence wins — so
   this overrides any flag the recipe already sets:

   ```bash
   python scripts/run_qwen3_dense.py --model-name Qwen3-4B \
       --extra-args "--lr 2e-6 --num-rollout 100"
   ```

2. **Set a script option, as a flag or an env var.** Anything on `ScriptArgs` can come
   from the command line or from `MILES_SCRIPT_*`:

   ```bash
   MILES_SCRIPT_MODEL_DIR=/mnt/models python scripts/run_qwen3_dense.py --model-name Qwen3-4B
   ```

3. **Edit the script.** The launcher is the canonical home of a recipe's
   hyperparameters and is meant to be read and edited — change the `_RECIPES` values or
   the flag blocks directly for anything you want to keep.

## What execute_train runs on your machine

The launcher hands the assembled flags to `U.execute_train`, which issues the `EXEC:`
commands you see in the log, in order:

1. Kills leftover `sglang`, `miles`, and `redis` processes and stops any previous Ray
   cluster.
2. Starts a fresh cluster with `ray start --head`, using `--num-gpus-per-node` GPUs.
3. Runs the launcher's `before_ray_job_submit` hook, if it has one (used for the ssh
   fan-out below).
4. Builds the Ray runtime env for the job: `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`,
   `CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1`, `NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE` (your exported value if set,
   otherwise probed with `nvidia-smi`), `MASTER_ADDR`, `no_proxy`, and a `PYTHONPATH`
   containing the repo root and `--megatron-path`, plus anything from
   `--extra-env-vars`.
5. Submits the job: `ray job submit -- python3 train.py <architecture flags>
   <recipe flags>`.

Two environment variables skip parts of this sequence:

| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `MILES_SCRIPT_EXTERNAL_RAY=1` | The Ray cluster is already running: skip the Ray teardown and `ray start`, only submit |
| `MILES_SCRIPT_ENABLE_RAY_SUBMIT=0` | Run everything except the submission — shows what a launcher would do |

The head-node address defaults to `127.0.0.1` and is taken from `MASTER_ADDR`; export
it on multi-node runs so Ray and torch distributed bind to the right interface.

## Multi-step and multi-node launchers

Two launcher shapes go beyond a single `execute()`.

### Subcommand pipelines: prepare-* and full-train

Large-model launchers split the pipeline — download, precision cast, `torch_dist`
conversion, training — into subcommands of one script (underscores in the function name
become dashes on the CLI):

```bash
python scripts/run_deepseek_v4.py prepare-download --model-name DeepSeek-V4-Flash-FP8
python scripts/run_deepseek_v4.py train --model-name DeepSeek-V4-Flash-FP8 \
    --num-nodes 8 --num-gpus-per-node 8
```

The `full-train` subcommand chains all steps and checks a sentinel file before each
one, so a completed step is skipped on re-run — after an interruption, relaunch the
same command and it resumes where it stopped.

### Joining multiple nodes: per-role subcommands and ssh fan-out

A multi-node run needs every node in the Ray cluster before the job is submitted.
Launchers express this in one of two ways:

- **One subcommand per node role.** `scripts/run_nemotron_3_super_120b_a12b.py` has
  `worker` (joins the head's cluster and blocks) and `train` (starts the head, waits
  until the cluster reports every GPU, then submits); you run one command on each node.
- **ssh fan-out from the head.** With `--join-ray-workers`,
  `scripts/run_qwen3_sft.py` sshes every host of an MPI-style hostfile into the
  cluster (`U.ssh_start_ray_workers` as the `before_ray_job_submit` hook), so the whole
  cluster comes up from a single command on the head node.

## Model architecture definitions in scripts/models/

Megatron cannot read the architecture from a HuggingFace checkpoint, so each
`megatron_model_type` has a file in `scripts/models/` named exactly after it, exposing
one function that returns the architecture flags:

```python
def model_args(**kwargs) -> str:
    return """
        --num-layers 36
        --hidden-size 2560
        ...
    """
```

`execute_train` resolves the file by name and splices its output into the `train.py`
command line ahead of the recipe flags. A variant (a layer-pruned debug model, a LoRA
target) derives from its base file with `load_sibling_model_args` instead of copying
it.

<Warning>

**Architecture parameters are not self-validating.** Two checkpoints from the same
family can ship different `--rotary-base`, vocab padding, or normalization epsilon.
Diff the checkpoint's `config.json` against the file in `scripts/models/` before a
first run, and override any drifted value by appending it, e.g.
`--extra-args "--rotary-base 10000"`.

</Warning>
